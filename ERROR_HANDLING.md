### Entity Errors

#### Climate Entity Not Found
**Message**: The target climate entity could not be found.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Verify the climate entity exists and is available
2. Check the entity ID is spelled correctly
3. Ensure the climate entity is not disabled
4. Try selecting a different climate entity

#### Climate Entity Unavailable
**Message**: The target climate entity is currently unavailable.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Check if the climate entity's underlying device is working
2. Verify the climate integration is functioning properly
3. Try restarting the climate entity's integration
4. Check Home Assistant logs for related errors

### Configuration Errors

#### Invalid Configuration
**Message**: The integration configuration contains invalid settings.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Review all configuration settings for typos or invalid values
2. Ensure temperature ranges are logical (min < max)
3. Verify entity IDs exist and are accessible
4. Check that all required fields are filled

#### Configuration Validation Failed
**Message**: The configuration could not be validated.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Check that all referenced entities exist
2. Verify temperature sensors provide numeric values
3. Ensure heater switches are controllable
4. Validate all entity IDs are correct

### Thermostat Errors

#### Thermostat Creation Failed
**Message**: Failed to create the generic thermostat entity.

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
1. Verify the heater switch entity exists and is controllable
2. Check the temperature sensor provides valid readings
3. Ensure entity IDs don't conflict with existing entities
4. Try using different entity names

## Diagnostic Services

The integration provides diagnostic services to help troubleshoot issues:

### Get Diagnostic Information

**Service**: `w100_smart_control.get_diagnostic_info`

Generates a comprehensive diagnostic report including:
- Home Assistant version information
- MQTT and Zigbee2MQTT status
- Device availability and last activity
- Climate entity status
- Created thermostat information

**Usage**:
```yaml
service: w100_smart_control.get_diagnostic_info
data:
  device_name: "living_room_w100"  # Optional
```

### Validate Setup

**Service**: `w100_smart_control.validate_setup`

Validates the current setup and identifies common issues:
- MQTT connectivity
- Device availability
- Entity status
- Configuration validation

**Usage**:
```yaml
service: w100_smart_control.validate_setup
```

## Configuration Flow Guidance

The configuration flow provides helpful guidance at each step:

### Device Selection
- **Help**: Select your W100 device from the list. If you don't see your device, make sure it's paired with Zigbee2MQTT and try refreshing.
- **Common Issues**: Device not appearing, device unavailable

### Climate Entity Selection
- **Help**: Choose an existing climate entity to control, or create a new generic thermostat if you don't have one.
- **Common Issues**: Entity not found, entity unavailable

### Thermostat Setup
- **Help**: Configure your heating system by selecting the heater switch and temperature sensor.
- **Common Issues**: Invalid entities, conflicting names

### Temperature Configuration
- **Help**: Set comfortable temperature ranges. The W100 uses 0.5Â°C increments.
- **Common Issues**: Invalid temperature ranges, precision mismatch

## Logging and Error Reporting

### Log Levels

The integration uses structured logging with different levels:

- **DEBUG**: Detailed operation information for troubleshooting
- **INFO**: Important operations and successful completions
- **WARNING**: Recoverable errors and degraded functionality
- **ERROR**: Failures that require attention

### Error Context

All error messages include contextual information:
- Device name
- Entity IDs
- Operation being performed
- Error codes for reference

### Example Log Entry

```
