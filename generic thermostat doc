Generic Thermostat
The generic_thermostat climate integration is a thermostat implemented in Home Assistant. It uses a sensor and a switch connected to a heater or air conditioning under the hood. When in heater mode, if the measured temperature is cooler than the target temperature, the heater will be turned on and turned off when the required temperature is reached. When in air conditioning mode, if the measured temperature is hotter than the target temperature, the air conditioning will be turned on and turned off when required temperature is reached. One Generic Thermostat entity can only control one switch. If you need to activate two switches, one for a heater and one for an air conditioner, you will need two Generic Thermostat entities.

Configuration 

To add the Generic Thermostat helper to your Home Assistant instance, use this My button:



 Manual configuration steps
If the above My button doesn’t work, you can also perform the following steps manually:

Browse to your Home Assistant instance.
Go to  Settings > Devices & Services.
At the top of the screen, select the tab: Helpers.
In the bottom right corner, select the  Create helper button.
From the list, select Generic Thermostat.
Follow the instructions on screen to complete the setup.
 Note

Configuration using our user interface provides a more limited subset of options, making this integration more accessible while covering most use cases.

If you need more specific features for your use case, the manual YAML-configuration section of this integration might provide them.

YAML configuration 

Alternatively, this integration can be configured and set up manually via YAML as well. To enable the integration, you need to add it to your configuration.yaml file. After changing the configuration.yaml file, restart Home Assistant to apply the changes. The integration is now shown on the integrations page under Settings > Devices & services. Its entities are listed on the integration card itself and on the Entities tab.

CONFIGURATION VARIABLES 
Looking for your configuration file?
name string REQUIRED, default: Generic Thermostat
Name of thermostat.
unique_id string (optional)
An ID that uniquely identifies this thermostat. Set this to a unique value to allow customization through the UI.
heater string REQUIRED
entity_id for heater switch, must be a toggle device. Becomes air conditioning switch when ac_mode is set to true.
target_sensor string REQUIRED
entity_id for a temperature sensor, target_sensor.state must be temperature.
min_temp float (optional, default: 7)
Set minimum set point available.
max_temp float (optional, default: 35)
Set maximum set point available.
target_temp float (optional)
Set initial target temperature. Failure to set this variable will result in target temperature being set to null on startup. As of version 0.59, it will retain the target temperature set before restart if available.
ac_mode boolean (optional, default: false)
Set the switch specified in the heater option to be treated as a cooling device instead of a heating device.
min_cycle_duration time | integer (optional)
Set a minimum amount of time that the switch specified in the heater option must be in its current state prior to being switched either off or on. This option will be ignored if the keep_alive option is set.
cold_tolerance float (optional, default: 0.3)
Set a minimum amount of difference between the temperature read by the sensor specified in the target_sensor option and the target temperature that must change prior to being switched on. For example, if the target temperature is 25 and the tolerance is 0.5, the heater will start when the sensor goes below 24.5.
hot_tolerance float (optional, default: 0.3)
Set a minimum amount of difference between the temperature read by the sensor specified in the target_sensor option and the target temperature that must change prior to being switched off. For example, if the target temperature is 25 and the tolerance is 0.5 the heater will stop when the sensor equals or goes above 25.5.
keep_alive time | integer (optional)
Set a keep-alive interval. If set, the switch specified in the heater option will be triggered every time the interval elapses. Use with heaters and A/C units that shut off if they don’t receive a signal from their remote for a while. Use also with switches that might lose state. The keep-alive call is done with the current valid climate integration state (either on or off). When keep_alive is set the min_cycle_duration option will be ignored.
initial_hvac_mode string (optional)
Set the initial HVAC mode. Valid values are off, heat or cool. Value has to be double quoted. If this parameter is not set, it is preferable to set a keep_alive value. This is helpful to align any discrepancies between generic_thermostat and heater state.
away_temp float (optional)
Set the temperature used by preset_mode: away.
comfort_temp float (optional)
Set the temperature used by preset_mode: comfort.
eco_temp float (optional)
Set the temperature used by preset_mode: eco.
home_temp float (optional)
Set the temperature used by preset_mode: home.
sleep_temp float (optional)
Set the temperature used by preset_mode: sleep.
activity_temp float (optional)
Set the temperature used by preset_mode: activity.
precision float (optional)
The desired precision for this device. Can be used to match your actual thermostat’s precision. Supported values are 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0. This value is also used as the step size for setting the target temperature.
Default: 0.1 for Celsius and 1.0 for Fahrenheit.
target_temp_step float (optional)
The desired step size for setting the target temperature. Supported values are 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0.
Default: equal to precision.
Time for min_cycle_duration and keep_alive must be set as “hh:mm:ss” or it must contain at least one of the following entries: days:, hours:, minutes:, seconds: or milliseconds:. Alternatively, it can be an integer that represents time in seconds.

Currently the generic_thermostat climate platform supports ‘heat’, ‘cool’ and ‘off’ HVAC modes. You can force your generic_thermostat to avoid starting by setting HVAC mode to ‘off’.

Please note that when changing the preset mode to away, you will force a target temperature change as well that will get restored once the preset mode is set to none again.
