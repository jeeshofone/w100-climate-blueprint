## [0.5] - 2025-07-03

### Changed
- Removed all debug logging for cleaner operation
- Optimized W100 display sync to only update when values have changed
- Optimized humidity sync to only update when value has changed
- Removed unnecessary time pattern triggers for W100 sync (was every 5 seconds)
- Removed unnecessary time pattern trigger for humidity sync (was every 2 minutes)
- Reduced unnecessary MQTT traffic and network overhead

### Improved
- Better performance with event-driven updates instead of polling
- W100 display now only updates on actual value changes
- Cleaner logs without debug messages

## [0.4] - 2025-07-02

### Added
- Comprehensive beep control with three modes:
  - Enable Beep: Always beep
  - Disable Beep: Never beep  
  - On-Mode Change: Smart beeping for important events only
- Beeps on temperature setpoint changes and manual on/off
- New inputs: fan_beep_switch and beep_mode

### Changed
- Excludes beeps from automatic workarounds
- Maintains beep state across restarts

## [0.3] - 2025-07-02

### Added
- Automatic detection of stuck heater scenarios
- Temperature sensor workaround feature
- When fan sensor reads 30Â°C but room is cooler:
  - Temporarily turns off smart thermostat
  - Runs fan at speed 6 for 2 minutes
  - Forces air circulation for accurate temperature reading

### Fixed
- Prevents fan from stopping heating prematurely

## [0.2] - 2025-07-02

### Changed
- Changed mode from "single" to "parallel" (max: 8)

### Improved
- Enhanced responsiveness for button presses and state changes
- Better handling of concurrent triggers

## [0.1] - 2025-07-01

### Added
- Complete PID-controlled fan with W100 remote integration
- Smart thermostat integration
- W100 display sync for temperature/humidity
- Heat/cool mode switching
- Fan speed control in cool mode
- Temperature control in heat mode
- Idle speed and warm level management
